# ImageSorter
View and sort images into subfolders

This is currently very much a work in progress so don't expect updates to be compatible with older databases.


## To Do List:
* [ ] Rework tagging to support all media types
* [ ] Add a page to manage tags. Add, delete etc.
* [ ] Add permissions so users can only see approved tags
* [ ] Rework page navigation
* [ ] Add page to view media searching by tag
* [ ] Dark theme
* [ ] Option to log in with a hardware security key instead of a password
* [ ] 

### Breaking Changes
* 2022/04/15 Deleted tag groups and reworked some things to hopefully make it easier to tag and sort media. Whilst doing so old migrations have been deleted which makes these changes incompatible with old databases.
